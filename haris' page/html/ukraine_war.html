        <p>
            On the 24nd of February 2022 the Russian Federation launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
            The invasion was precipitated by a military build-up of forces by the Russian federation on the
            Russo-Ukrainian border from March 2021 [1]. During the build-up Russian officials denied any intention
            of invading Ukraine, while engaging in negotiations with the United States about barring Ukraine from
            ever joining NATO as well as removing all NATO forces from easter NATO members that joined the defensive
            after the collapse of the Soviet Union [2].
        </p>

        <p>
            The negations produced little results as the atlantic alliance found most Russian demands
            to be unacceptable and unreasonable as they went against multiple core NATO principles -
            collective defense and an open door policy for perspective members. The western alliance did offer
            some minor concessions and trust building exercises, but Russia very clearly rejected this offer by
            invading Ukraine [2]. The rhetoric coming from Russian officials as to why the invasion was necessary boiled
            down to a couple of key points.

        <h2 class="paragraph_title">Claimed Reasons For The Invasion</h2>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>NATO expansion after the collapse of the Soviet Union into Easter Europe, the traditional sphere of influence claimed by Russian, threatens Russia's security. [5]</li>
            <li>The continuing low intensity conflict in Easter Ukraine that threatens Russian speakers in those territories and Russia sees itself as the protectors of all Russians - as such it has a duty to intervene. [4]</li>
            <li>A supposedly extremist nazi government has come to power in Ukraine and is persecuting everyone and especially ethnic Russians. [3]</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="paragraph_title">NATO Expansion</h2>
        <p>
            The first statement if while being factually true [6], does not at all justify the invasion - the countries in
            Easter Europe joined NATO willingly and with great enthusiasm after the collapse of communism and were not
            tricked or pressured into joining as Russia often claims [7]. The reason for this is quite simple - Russia has
            been the historical oppressor and tyrant of the region for most of recent history [8] and the countries of
            Easter Europe sought the protection of the western alliance from any possible future Russian aggression [7].
            Of course, from Russia's perspective, Easter European countries joining NATO goes against its interests
            since it still lays claim to its former sphere of influence, but this perspective ignores the rights of the
            countries in Easter Europe to self determine and engage with countries that they themselves want to engage
            with, so the argument is ultimately moot. Additionally, the argument that the security of Russia is
            threatened NATO expansion is moot given the fact that Russia posses the largest nuclear arsenal in the world,
            rendering any possible large scale invasion of Russia suicidal. Ironically enough, the invasion of Ukraine prompted
            traditionally neutral countries Sweden and Finland to apply to join NATO [20].

        <h2 class="paragraph_title">"Russia As The Protector Of All Russians"</h2>
        <p>
            The second statement has two important components to it - the Russian Federation is the protector of all
            Russians [9] and that ethnic Russians are being killed by the conflict in the Donbas [4]. The first component is
            little but Russian imperialism wrapped up in a nice little bow. The USSR and the Russian Empire engaged in
            ethnic cleansing [10] and colonization of conquered regions to install a Russian population in the area that
            would be loyal to Moscow to be able to control the regions [11]. As well as to stake a permanent claim to the
            region in the form of ethnic Russians living in the region so even if the region gained its independence
            that Russia would always have an excuse to annex it again under the guise of "protecting ethnic Russians".
            As for the second component - the conflict in the Donbas was instigated and perpetuated by the
            Russian Federation [12] in an attempt to prevent Ukraine
            from being able to align itself with the West by instigating a rebellion in the East of the country.
            The covert and overt support of the Russian Federation to the self-proclaimed Luhansks Peoples Republic (LNR)
            and Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) is well documented [12][13]. Additionally, many of the leaders of the
            DNR and LNR have Russian Intelligence ties - best exemplified by Igor "Strelkov" Girkin the former Defense
            minister of the DNR having long-standing ties to the Russian FSB [14].
        </p>

        <h2 class="paragraph_title">Supposed Ukrainian Nazism</h2>

        <p>
            The last argument is usually justified by invoking the Azov Regiment - a military regiment that has its
            roots in an ultra-nationalist militia that came to be in 2014 in response to the fighting in Easter Ukraine [15].
            While the neo-fascist roots of the organization are hard to deny, after their incorporation into the armed forces
            of Ukraine the formation has undergone a substantial move away from its neo-nazi roots [15]. It had to move away from such an extreme position
            for a simple reason - the military ultimately can not be allowed to incorporate subversive extremist elements.
            So either Azov moved away from its neo-fascist roots or was going to be eventually purged from the armed forces.
            The reason why such an organization was even incorporated into the armed forces
            was that the Ukrainian government was desperate for anyone willing to fight the Russian supported rebellion
            in the Easter part of Ukraine back in 2014 [15]. Additionally, no far-right parties currently hold any seats in
            the Ukrainian parliament [15] (ironically, the few seats held by far right parties have eroded since 2014, which
            they managed to acquire due to the War in the Donbas). Finally, the nazism argument is completely absurd in
            the face of the fact that the current president of Ukraine - Volodymyr Zelenskyy - is Jewish [16]. And the
            oppression argument fares little better as Zelenskyy is a native Russian speaker [17].

        <p>
            Overall, the Russian justification for the invasion falls apart quite rapidly when subjected to
            scrutiny, and it becomes clear that Russia had ulterior motives for it. But the Russians keep moving the
            goal post about the justification as is convenient to them. To the international community the
            justification is NATO
            expansionism [18], to the domestic audience it is the protection of Russians [4] in the Donbass and to the
            population in the conquered regions of Ukraine it is to "liberate" them from the supposed "Nazism" [19].
            So what is the actual goal of the Russian Federation? Simple - the reconquest of supposed "lost lands".
