        <p>
            A large round of layoff appears to have started over at Goldman Sachs cutting up to 3200 jobs as
            reported by the New York Times [1]. Having such a major bank investment as Goldman Sachs cut a large
            number of jobs does not bode well for stock markets foreseeable future.

        <h2 class="paragraph_title">The Larger Picture</h2>

        <p>
            The with record low interest rates held by central banks before the pandemic [2] and as government stimulus
            flowed during the pandemic to support national economies during the pandemic [2] it put a lot of new cash into
            the market and made it easy for investment banks such as Goldman Sachs to make billions in profits.
            After all if everyone is putting money in, just buying any sensible asset on the market was almost a surefire
            bet to make money. But now that the cheap credit gravy train is over as central banks engage in aggressive
            interest hikes [2] to try to tame inflation the historic bull run by the stock market appears to have
            finally come a definitive halt.
        </p>

        <h2 class="paragraph_title">The Future</h2>

        <p>
            The future currently looks not so bright for the stock market in the foreseeable future as darling tech stocks
            during the pandemic such as Facebook  have seen significant portions of their market valuation
            wiped out [3]. This comes due to the realization that the significant up-tick in sales that these companies
            saw during the pandemic were not permanent and as economies open up again - income streams for these darlings
            started to decrease [4]. Currently, there does not appear to be any replacement for these darling stocks
            and the general market sentiment is negative.
        </p>
