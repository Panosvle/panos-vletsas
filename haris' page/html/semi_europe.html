        <p>
            After much courting by the European Union one of the big semiconductor manufacturers finally bit - Intel.
            Intel has announced plans to invest tens of Billions of dollars over the next ten years in Europe to build
            state-of-the-art manufacturing, packaging and research and development facilities [1].

        <p>
            This comes after years of concerted efforts by the EU to bring back some advanced semiconductor manufacturing
            from Asia back to the EU to ensure that the EU will have access to advanced semiconductors even if disruptions
            happen back in Asia [2].
        </p>

        <h2 class="paragraph_title">Possible Disruptions</h2>

        <p>
            The pandemic made it painfully obvious the interconnectedness of the modern day global economy and also
            highlighted how many countries in the world rely on each other for critical inputs for their economies
            and that if these supply chains are disrupted the economic pay becomes almost immediate [2]. One particularly
            glaring example of this phenomenon were semiconductors [3].
        </p>
        <p>
            The majority of the worlds advanced are manufactured in Taiwan by the Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC [4].
            Covid disrupted both work in these plants as well shipments of finished products from these plants to customers.
            As the demand for semiconductors rapidly rose once everyone was stuck in-doors thanks to the pandemic, combined
            with the manufacturing disruptions there arose a significant chip shortage in many parts of the world resulting in
            rapid electronic price increases [5].

        <p>
            Lessons from COVID-19 are not the only thing worrying both EU and other world officials, particularly American
            officials - it is China [7].
            China's growing assertiveness and rapidly expanding military raise the specter of war
            over the pacific island of Taiwan [6]. China still claims the island as its own even decades after the effective
            end of the Chinese Civil War following World War 2 which resulted in the Communist seizing control of mainland
            China and the defeated Kuomintang fleeing to the island of Formosa [8]. Recent statements by the leader of China -
            Xi Jinping - clearly state that China is still not renouncing possibility of the use of force in its campaign
            to bring Taiwan into its fold [6].
        </p>
        <h2 class="paragraph_title">Implications For Europe</h2>
        <p>
            The benefits of on-shoring advanced semiconductor manufacturing back in Europe will likely not result in much
            benefit for consumers as almost all consumer electronics are assembled in Asia. But the benefits will most likely
            be clearly seen in the security of supply chains for industries in Europe such as car manufacturers and defense
            companies.
