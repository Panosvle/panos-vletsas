                <p>On the 22nd of February 2022 the Russian Federation launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
                    The invasion was precipitated by a military build-up of forces by the Russian federation on the
                    Russo-Ukrainian border from March 2021.</p>

                <p>
                    A large round of layoff appears to have started over at Goldman Sachs cutting up to 3200 jobs as
                    reported by the New York Times. Having such a major bank investment as Goldman Sachs cut a large
                    number of jobs does not bode well for stock markets foreseeable future.
