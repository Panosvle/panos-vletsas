    <div><h1>miHoYo Changes Genshin Impact Publisher To Cognosphere, Is The Game Really Shutting Down?</h1><span>Lately, the publisher of Genshin Impact has changed to Cognosphere, from miHoYo. This grabbed the attention of many fans out there and they started to wonder what is going with the game. In fact, a number of YouTubers out there started making videos stating that the game's end is near, and Genshin Impact is shutting down. Is the game actually shutting down though?</span>
      <p>Well, not likely. In fact, far from it. The change in publisher was made after the integration of various payment methods on EGS. miHoYo highlights that "with more entities engaged, the publisher of Genshin Impact on Epic Games Store has been updated to COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD."</p>
      <p>It is a common practice for developers to change publishers to bypass the restrictions of the country they are based in.</p>
