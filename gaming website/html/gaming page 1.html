        <div><h1>Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker was released December 7</h1><span>two weeks later, queues to log in can still be thousands of players long. An influx of new players paired with a highly-anticipated expansion pack made it so subscribers sometimes must wait an hour or more during peak periods. Square Enix expected login issues during Endwalker, but not quite to this extent, and has since been offering compensation to subscribers while the developers do their best to get the situation under control.</span>
        <p>Before FFXIV: Endwalker's patch 6.01, Error 2002 sometimes disconnected players who were actively waiting in the queue to log in. In some cases, this forced them to start again from the back of the line, which was especially frustrating when the queue was already in the thousands. The mystery of this error, a relic from the original iteration of FFXIV, has finally been solved. Fixing the source of Error 2002 has removed at least one problem plaguing the game, and now FFXIV's patch notes have wrapped up a decade-long tale of its own alongside Endwalker's finale.</p></div>
